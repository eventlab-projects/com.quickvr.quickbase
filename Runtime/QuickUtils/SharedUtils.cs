//This file contains common classes and extension methods used accross different QuickVR packages. 
//Ideally, there should be a package QuickVR.Dependencies.Base and set all those common code on that 
//github. However, Unity packages does not currently supports defining git dependencies at the package
//level (i.e., on the package.json file), only on the manifest.json file of the project. 

//In order to simplify the installation process for the final user, this shared file will be copied 
//(and properly renamed its namespace) across all the packages needing these features, until Unity
//finally introduces package dependencies from git.
